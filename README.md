The Travlr Getaways project demonstrates how a full stack web application integrates both server-side and client-side technologies to deliver a dynamic, interactive experience. The Express portion of the project serves the customer-facing site, using static HTML and Handlebars templates rendered on the server, while the Angular single-page application (SPA) powers the administrative dashboard. The SPA’s modular structure, built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, allows for reusable components and faster interactions without full page reloads. This makes it ideal for administrative functions such as adding, editing, and deleting trips. The backend relies on a NoSQL MongoDB database because of its flexibility and compatibility with JSON, which provides a seamless way to store and transfer data between the frontend and backend through the Express API.
Testing involved verifying that the SPA communicated correctly with the API using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, as well as ensuring secure login authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Using browser developer tools and console logs, I confirmed that data was being retrieved and updated properly in MongoDB. Refactoring throughout the process improved efficiency, including separating reusable UI components and refining API service methods for cleaner code and better maintainability. This course helped me connect all parts of stack and strengthened my understanding of RESTful APIs, routing, authentication, and modular design. I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience in building and securing modern web applications, which will make me more marketable in my future software development career.
